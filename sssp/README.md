# Parallel single-source shortest path algorithm 


In algorithmic graph theory, a fundamental challenge is the shortest path problem. A broader variant of this problem is the single-source shortest paths (SSSP) problem, which involves finding the shortest paths from a given source vertex $s$ to all other vertices in the graph. Traditionally, this problem is solved using classical sequential algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm. However, I introduce a parallel algorithm designed to solve the SSSP problem know as Delta stepping algorithm.
