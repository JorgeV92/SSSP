# SSSP

 ### Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP)
 *  Calculate the shortest path distance from a single vertex in the graph to all other vertices.

   The goal is to study the performance of algorithms for *SSSP* using parallel computation in c++ using SYCL. 
   The first attempt will be to translate the implementation done in CUDA by NVIDIA into SYCL and match the performance or possibly out perform the CUDA version. 
   The CUDA version can be found here [SSSP](https://github.com/tpn/cuda-samples/blob/master/v8.0/7_CUDALibraries/nvgraph_SSSP/nvgraph_SSSP.cpp)
